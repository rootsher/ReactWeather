# React Weather Application

## TODO list:

* learn markdown syntax (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for better writing README files :)
* write instruction for build this application with webpack
* read about (container and presentation) / (smart and dumb) components
* add public directory to `.gitignore` file
